# ql

[![checks](https://github.com/pmeinhardt/ql/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pmeinhardt/ql/actions/workflows/checks.yml)

Preview files from the command-line using macOS Quick Look.

Open a file in Quick Look from the command-line:

```shell
ql <path/to/file>
```

Yes, there is `qlmanage`. But youâ€™d always have `[DEBUG]` staring at you.

## Building ðŸª›

In order to build the `ql` command, run:

```shell
make
```

This requires macOS 12.0+ with `swiftc` installed.

You can copy the resulting binary anywhere you like or add the `bin/` directory to your `PATH`.

## Vim plugin ðŸ”©

There is a Vim plugin for `ql`. If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this line to your Vim configuration file:

```vim
Plug 'pmeinhardt/ql', {'do': ':QuickLookCompile'}
```

The plugin provides a `:QuickLook [path]` command and `<Plug>` mappings. If you invoke it without a `[path]`, it will show a preview of the current buffer contents. See [`.vimrc.develop`](./.vimrc.develop) for usage examples.

You can use the plugin, even if you cannot build `ql` itself. If the `ql` binary is not found, the plugin will fall back to using `qlmanage` if available or `open`. In this case, leave out the `{'do': ':QuickLookCompile'}` part of the plugin integration above to avoid build errors when upgrading your Vim plugins.

It is probably possible to integrate other file previewers like [GNOME sushi](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/sushi). If you are up for it, I am happy about pull-requests.
